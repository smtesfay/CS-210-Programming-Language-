# CS-210-Programming-Language-
In this project, we are working on educating students the concepts of fiscal responsibility like spending less than they make  via this interactive coding system. This project mainly focuses on investing and how their investment will grow over time. I think one thing I particularly did well is that I was able to calculate the interst rate of their initial investment of the years they earned and also displaying the input for the user. I think the code could need some improvements on security since we dealig with money and it needs to be updated and check on the for loops. I think the most challenging part of the code was the for loops becuase it took me some time figure out but eventually I was able to overcome it by taking some time off from the code and after few tries again I was able to solve it. Some resources I am adding to my networking is by taking to my peers and people on the field. Some skills that are transferable to other projects from this project is that you need to be patient and keep practing becuase most of the time it does not really work on the first try and above all I also learned about investing that I could apply to my daily life. In order to make this program maintainable,readable, and adaptable  there should a comment for ever line on that its trying to do, it needs to constantly be updated and check security compliance.
